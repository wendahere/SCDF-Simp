## Problem Overview
The importance of SCDF's fleet of vehicles in responding to crises cannot be understated. However, like any other form of transportation, they require maintenance and inspections to ensure that they function in optimal condition. It is therefore desired that a maintenance solution be designed that both reflects the need for reliability, while being economical and cost friendly

Our solution therefore seeks to use Artificial Intelligence to achieve a data based, predictive maintenance platform, with which maintenance of the SCDF Fleet of vehicles can be carried out.

By tapping in on OEM installed sensors on each vehicle, we are able to perform analysis using a cloud based solution to deliver value added insights, helping optimize and reduce maintenance efforts and costs.
